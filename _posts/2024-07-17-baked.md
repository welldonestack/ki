  Designing the best-of-best album and tour collateral for the band MAROON5 was challenging in terms of making the typography stand out while capturing the essence of the band's identity and the album itself. The whole package share the core story but transforms according to the medium. The arrangement of the type was inspired by Alan Fletcher’s 1983 "PARTY" poster.

#### Maroon 5 creates music for everyone—easy listening and catchy songs. In this regard, the album concept should be straightforward and memorable. “Baked” is a word with many layers of meaning, but most of all, it evokes a sense of smell, warm passion, and goodness. Embracing the cookie concept, the soft, round, yet chunky font "Podium Soft Regular" was chosen, along with a colorful yet neutral palette.

↳ Details were added visualizing the texture of slightly burnt cookies. The lyrics are simple yet employ the rhythm of toaster holes and single alphabets that represent the cookie cutter.

↳ The neon sign you see at Krispy Kreme, indicating a fresh donut just out, aligns with the concept of the music being freshly 'baked' and ready to be launched.

↳ The concept of tickets resembling cookie boxes gives you the feeling of holding something good in your hand, ready to be experienced. It's akin to the moment when your tickets are collected and the performance is about to start.
