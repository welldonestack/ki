#### Maroon 5 is a pop-rock band. Not manic, they create music for everyone—easy listening and catchy songs. In this regard, the album concept should be straightforward and memorable. 'Baked' is a word with many layers of meaning, but most of all, it evokes a sense of smell, warm passion, and goodness. Embracing the cookie concept, the soft, round, yet chunky font 'Podium Soft Regular' was chosen, along with a colorful yet neutral palette.

↳ Every bit of the cover ties into the ‘baking’ concept.
#### Little details were added, inspired by the texture of slightly burnt cookies. The lyrics are simple yet employ the rhythm of toaster holes and single alphabets that represent the cookie cutter.

↳ The neon sign you see at Krispy Kreme, indicating a fresh donut just out, aligns with the concept of the music being freshly 'baked' and ready to be launched.

↳ The concept of tickets resembling cookie boxes or donut boxes gives you the feeling of holding something good in your hand, ready to be experienced. It's akin to the moment when your tickets are collected and the performance is about to start.
