  The band LANY’s image is playful yet also carries a hint of sarcasm, a duality that is reflected in their music. Bright sounds mingle with melancholic undertones, reminiscent of a late summer afternoon sunset. With these characteristics in mind, I intend to seek out objects that create an intriguing juxtaposition, enhancing the band’s unique aesthetic.
